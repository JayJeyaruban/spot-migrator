# Spot-Migrator

Basic library that takes JSON files and uses the Spotify Python SDK (Spotipy) to generate libraries in Spotify. While not restricted to, it is based on the playlist JSON output of [gpmchecker](https://github.com/thisispiggy/gpmchecker).

Will expand to include entire library transfer.
